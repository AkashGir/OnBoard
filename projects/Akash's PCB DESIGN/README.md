# My USB-A HUB created by using PCB Design

SO the objective of this Hub is so that in laptops/computers when there arent multiple USB-A type ports available to use, a USB Hub helps a lot by using one input into the laptop
but connects multiple devices at once. My USB HUB can connect 2 devices simultaneously into a single socket present in the laptop. This would help me in my organization. :)

The price for this is shown in the screenshot below -->
